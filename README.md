- 👋 Hi, I’m Florian Mrugalla

Github told me to make this read me file in order to introduce myself to you all.
I guess that makes sense. Funnily Github gave me some ideas on what to talk about here.
The first one being...

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

VST plugins. Or maybe obsessed would be a better term for a lack
of a more elegant word. I mean, I make music constantly and I also develop them.
I basically want to deal with VST plugins all day long. That is my life.
Oh, but I'm also interested in cute cats and riding my bicycle. My favourite
anime is Initial D. Idk if that matters. Oh yes, and I have a YouTube channel
where I'm doing things: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTAQ7ro8z1f8jufCDGogTw

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Currently learning how to make even better plugins.
I just want to be the best. I don't just wanna make another boring
hardware compressor emulation, unless I personally experienced it, but
not because the market asks for it. I wanna find innovative sounds and workflows.
That might sound a bit like a generic phrase, but it's hard to sum up all
your ideas in a neat little text, you know.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

If you're a musician, sounddesigner or developer, just talk to me.
I love discussing all the ideas that are out there.

I'd also like sponsors to appear for my YouTube channel, unless it's
scam. I am not against advertisement, but I don't wanna pretend like
VPN is going to change your life or anything. Come with something cool, ok?
If your product is cool I will surely advertise it.

- 📫 How to reach me ...

This is the email address I made for these kinds of things: beatsbasteln@web.de
You can also talk to me on discord: https://discord.gg/m4MtvdAe8E
