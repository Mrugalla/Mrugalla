- 👋 Hi, I’m Florian Mrugalla

Github told me to make this read me file in order to introduce myself to you all.
I guess that makes sense. Funnily Github gave me some ideas on what to talk about here.
The first one being...

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

I'm interested in VST plugins. Or maybe obsessed would be a better term for a lack
of a more elegant word. I mean, I make music constantly and I also develop them.
I basically want to deal with VST plugins all day long. That is my life.
Oh, but I'm also interested in cute cats and riding my bicycle. My favourite
anime is Initial D. Idk if that matters. Oh yes, and I have a YouTube channel
where I show what I'm doing sometimes. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTAQ7ro8z1f8jufCDGogTw

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Currently learning how to write even better code and make even better plugins.
I just want to be the best. I don't just wanna make another boring
hardware compressor emulation, unless I personally experienced it, but
not because the market asks for it. I also don't wanna make another Pro-Q
derivate, except if it has a twist that makes it something new. I wanna find
innovative sounds and yeah, that might sound a bit like a generic phrase,
but it's hard to sum up all your ideas in a neat little text, you know.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

If you're a musician, sounddesigner or developer, just talk to me.
I love discussing all the ideas that are out there.

I'd also like sponsors to appear for my YouTube channel, unless it's
scam. I am not against advertisement, but I don't wanna pretend like
VPN is going to change your life or anything. Come with something cool, ok?

- 📫 How to reach me ...

I guess my email address would be a good start.. should I put my main email address here tho?
I should make a new one for these kinds of things at some point...
