My name is Florian Mrugalla!

I've been an electronic musician for most of my life and I who dove into audio programming in 2019
by manipulating the scripts that came with Blue Cat Audio's Plug'n Script. My first success was
to change a mid/side script that removes the side content, to only remove the mid content instead.
That was simple, yet something none of my other plugins did back then, so it inspired me to
become a plugin developer. In the beginning I experimented mostly with waveshapers and bitcrushers, as those are easy to
implement while already having a big impact on the sound. I also wrote some granular effects,
envelopes and oscillators.

In 2020 I started to learn JUCE and C++, because I wanted to give my plugins their own identity and
felt like I needed more flexibility and performance for that. I experimented with JUCE'
fourier transform class and audio delays.

My first "real" plugin release, NEL-19 (later NEL) in 2020 was a vibrato plugin with a random
modulator, an attempt to enable users to add lofi vibrato to sounds without audio degredation.
I kept on improving this plugin and now it has a complex modulation system, macro controls,
full resizability and many more innovative features.

Around that time I also started working as a beta tester for various other plugin developers,
like Dawesome, Polyverse or Lese. My unique position in this field enables me to see
problems from both the perspective of the user as well as the developer.
My biggest strengths in that regard are that I inspect workflows very closely and
don't just look at the combination of audio processing features. Also I have a
strong focus on details, like parameter smoothing or sensitive mouse inputs.

I made a lot more plugins in the meantime, like one that plays back GIF animations,
one that uses a physics simulation of gravity to modulate parallel delays,
a resonator, various MIDI effects like one that holds monophonic inputs to make
vocoders easier to use and a pitchshifter.

I am proficient in the DAWs Cubase and Bitwig. I have used Cubase for many years,
but I'm a Bitwig power user since 2022. I also have a bit of experience with
Reaper, Ableton and FL Studio. Not so much in Logic and Pro Tools.

This is my YouTube channel, on which I document a lot of the things, that I'm doing:
